treem - Neuron Morphology Processing Tool
=========================================

The `treem` module (pronounced "trim") provides data structures and
command-line tools for accessing and manipulating digital reconstructions
of neuronal morphology in the Stockley-Wheal-Cannon (SWC) format.

Main classes
------------

Access to morphological data from the source code is provided through the
classes ``Tree``, ``Node``, ``Morph``, and ``SWC``:

* ``Tree``   - Recursive tree data structure
* ``Node``   - Morphology data storage
* ``Morph``  - Neuron morphology representation
* ``SWC``    - Definitions of the data format


Commands
--------

Common operations with SWC files can be performed using the ``swc``
command-line tool:

    swc <command> [options] file

Alternatively:

    swc <command> file [file ...] [options] 

List of ``swc`` commands:

* ``check``    - tests morphology reconstruction for structural consistency
* ``convert``  - converts morphology to compliant SWC format
* ``find``     - locates single nodes in the reconstruction
* ``measure``  - calculates morphometric features
* ``modify``   - manipulates morphology reconstruction
* ``render``   - displays 3D model of the reconstruction
* ``repair``   - corrects reconstruction errors
* ``view``     - shows morphology structure


Installation
------------

Install the latest stable release:

    pip install treem

Install a development version:

    pip install git+https://github.com/a1eko/treem

See also ``pip`` documentation for installation alternatives.


Dependencies
------------

The ``treem`` module has minimal runtime dependencies:

* Python >= 3.7
* ``matplotlib``
* ``numpy``
* ``PyOpenGL`` (optional, enables ``swc render`` command)

For testing and documentation, ``treem`` requires additional development packages with
third-party extensions:

* ``sphinx`` with ``napoleon`` and ``programoutput`` extensions
* ``pytest`` with ``pytest-cov`` plugin
* ``sphinx-rtd-theme``
* ``coverage``
